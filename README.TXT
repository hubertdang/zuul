This project was a simple framework for an adventure game. In the original 
version, it had a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
That's all.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

This project was written as a continuation of the provided starting point of 
a small Java project.

Read chapter 7 of the book to get a detailed description of the project.
